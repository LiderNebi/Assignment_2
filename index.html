        <p>You get a shiver in the dark</p>
        <p>It's raining in the park, but meantime</p>
        <p>South of the river, you stop, and you hold everything</p>
        <p>A band is blowing Dixie, double-four time</p>
        <p>You feel alright when you hear the music ring</p>
      </div>

      <div class="secondpar">
        <p>Well, now you step inside But you don't see too many faces</p>
        <p>Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down</p>
        <p>Competition in other places</p>
        <p>Ah, but the horns, they blowing that sound</p>
        <p>Way on down south</p>
        <p>Way on down south, London town</p>
      </div>

      <div class="thirdpar">
        <p>Check out guitar George</p>
        <p>He knows all the chords</p>
        <p>Mind, it's strictly rhythm</p>
        <p>He doesn't want to make it cry or sing</p>
        <p>Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford</p>
        <p>When he gets up under the lights to play his thing</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fourthpar">
        <p>And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene</p>
        <p>He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright</p>
        <p>He can play the Honky Tonk like anything</p>
        <p>Saving it up for Friday night</p>
        <p>With the Sultans</p>
        <p>With the Sultans of Swing</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fifthpar">
        <p>And a crowd of young boys</p>
        <p>They're fooling around in the corner</p>
        <p>Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies</p>
        <p>And their platform soles</p>
        <p>They don't give a damn</p>
        <p>About any trumpet playing band</p>
        <p>It ain't what they call Rock and Roll</p>
        <p>And the Sultans</p>
        <p>Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole Creole</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sixthpar">
        <p>And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone</p>
        <p>And says at last, just as the time bell rings</p>
        <p>“Goodnight, now it's time to go home”</p>
        <p>Then he makes it fast with one more thing</p>
        <p>“We are the Sultans—</p>
        <p>We are the Sultans of Swing”</p>
